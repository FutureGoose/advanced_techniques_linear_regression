# Advanced Techniques in Supervised Machine Learning: Linear Regression Deep Dive

## Overview
Expanding on "Fundamentals of Supervised Machine Learning: OLS Linear Regression" this project delves deeper into supervised learning with a concentrated analysis of California's housing market. It aims to enhance our understanding and application of machine learning through:
- **Targeted Distribution Study**: Examining skewed and bimodal distributions for their modeling implications.
- **Precision Data Preparation**: Strategic imputation for outliers and missing values to maintain data integrity.
- **Innovative Feature Engineering**: Employing arithmetic and statistical methods to craft meaningful features.
- **Robust EDA Methods**: Utilizing varied EDA techniques to uncover patterns that impact our target outcome.
- **Regression Technique Expansion**: Exploring dummy encoding and OLS regression to enhance feature selection and insight extraction.
- **scikit-learn Optimization**: Utilizing scikit-learn's pipeline for efficient, integrated preprocessing and modeling.
- **Polynomial Feature Dynamics**: Incorporating polynomial transformations to address non-linear patterns in the data.
- **Normalization via Log Transformation**: Utilizing log transformations to balance skewed distributions and minimize outlier effects.
- **Regularization for Model Stability**: Applying Ridge and Lasso regularization to prevent overfitting and promote model generalization.
- **Targeted Quantile Regression**: Applying Quantile Regression to gain precise insights across varying property value ranges, ideal for skewed data and outliers.
- **Model Evaluation and Refinement**: Assessing model fit against complex data distributions to inform and adapt our modeling approach.

The second installment in our series enhances our machine learning toolkit with sophisticated strategies tailored to the nuances of supervised learning.
