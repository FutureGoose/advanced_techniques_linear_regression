# Linear Regression in Machine Learning: Part 2

## Overview
Expanding on "Linear Regression in Machine Learning: Part 1," this project delves deeper into supervised learning with a concentrated analysis of California's housing market. It aims to enhance our understanding and application of machine learning through:

- Analyzing both exponential and bimodal distributions.
- Improving data quality with advanced preprocessing techniques.
- Creating insightful features through arithmetic and statistical methods.
- Conducting in-depth EDA to identify determinants of housing prices.
- Integrating OLS regression insights with `scikit-learn` for model optimization.
- Evaluating model performance to ensure robustness and applicability.

## Project Highlights
- **Feature Engineering**: Demonstrates the impact of engineered features on model insights.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Focuses on the importance of handling missing values correctly, showcasing median imputation's effectiveness.
- **EDA**: Advanced visualizations and analyses reveal critical relationships between key variables.
- **Model Building**: Illustrates the transition from statistical analysis to practical modeling with `scikit-learn`, highlighting efficiency and accuracy.
- **Result Analysis**: Confirms the model's reliability through comprehensive metrics, emphasizing a pragmatic approach to machine learning challenges.

## Dataset
The dataset centers on the housing market in California, with variables like "median_income" and "ocean_proximity." Through meticulous exploration, we extract valuable insights into the factors influencing housing prices.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data handling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **`scikit-learn`**: For modeling and preprocessing.
- **Statsmodels**: For detailed statistical analysis.
